 * As there is no single point of truth when it comes to the Nostr network (there are many),

 * In this example we provide an example how to fetch metadata of a given pubkey into a Profile object.
 * Much metadata can be found in so-called lists and sets which are stored as events on relays.
 * See NIP-51 for an overview with these different types of lists: https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/51.md
